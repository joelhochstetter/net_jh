Contains network algorithms written by me or otherwise useful in MATLAB, Python and C . 

These algorithms are written by me unless otherwise stated. 

These algorithms are generic and not written specifically for simulations of "Atomic Switch Networks" / "Neuromorphic Nanowire Networks". For specific network algortithms designed to analyse these specific networks see "asn_jh"
